# RasPi_Test
Currently there are only files that I found on the small robot.
The OS is a weird version of Ubuntu and it has CMU secruity thing that doesn't allow me to use internet (Like google...)

#To do
- Flash Raspi OS into ths SD card and start fresh.
- Need to find a SD card writer to do this.
